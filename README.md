# End to end Machine Learning Project with Deployment
The primary goal of this project is to deploy a Machine Learning solution using various different tools for deployment.

## Project Guidelines
1. Good code with a high degree of readability with comments
2. Well-structured code following software engineering principles
3. Modular code structure to replicate industry grade code
4. Deployment ready code for any platform

## Project Roadmap
Here are a few milestones in the project roadmap which should give an idea of how this project is structured and built.
1. First we need to build the barebones of the project itself in a Jupyter notebook. This will serve two purposes. We can see if our implementaiton of the code works. We can do all necessary tweaking to our models, hyperparameters etc. We can also visualize our code. This also ensures that the datasets doesn't throw any curveballs at us during production. Going further, when writing modular code, we will spimply split all the functionality of the notebook into different scripts for better use.
    * Create a Jupyter notebook to perform Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Create a Jupyter notebook for Model Training and Evaluation
2. Create a Custom Exception Handling script to customize how error messages are displayed. This will also help us use try-catch blocks of code to help us when encountering errors.
3. Create a Logging scripts. This essentially create a log file of all the log messages we use at various points to keep track of how the code works its way through the package.
